Tamale recipe
There are just two main steps to making homemade tamales.

1. The dough, called “masa”

2. the filling.

You can fill the tamales with whatever meat and sauce combination you like, or fill them with beans and cheese. I have provided the recipes for a pork and red sauce filling, and a chicken and green sauce filling.
